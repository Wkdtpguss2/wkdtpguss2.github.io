				<h2>Jayden Chang</h2>
				<p>My name is Jayden Chang. I am currently a 4th year student majoring in Economics at Wisconsin State University. I came to the United States to study at the age of 17 and graduated from high school in Milwaukee. After completing his sophomore year at university, he enlisted in the Korean army in October 2019. This is the first semester after returning to school after completing 2 years of military service. I am so happy to be here again!</p>

				<h1 class="headings">TRAVELING</h1>
				<p>Travel can also be said to be the reason for life for me. From a young age, I realized how fun and valuable it is to experience a completely different culture while traveling to many countries. If I have time and spare time, I will continue to travel continuously in the future.</p>

				<h1 class="headings">MOVIES</h1>
				<p>Usually I recharge my energy by spending time alone. When I'm alone, I often watch movies. I like movies that make me think a lot while watching, or movies that leave a deep impression after watching. Lately, I've been watching Christopher Nolan's movies a lot..</p>
